Artist Statement 

I have a strong interest in the natural world and the colors and forms found therein. 
This is often the inspiration for my art and design work. This will be the 
inspiration for the poem in this class. As I began brainstorming for material 
to write a poem I began to pull ideas from the forest. I want my poem to describe 
the feeling of a forest in late spring.

In order to achieve this I plan to accumulate a group of nouns, verbs, adjectives
 and adverbs of create a poem describing the feeling the. I will focus on words
 that describe the temperature, lighting, foliage, and color.  
 The intent is that these will words will combine to create a feeling
 and environment of the natural world.

The effervescent forest slowly enchants the wander
while the warm sunlight softly filters through viridian leaves.
The wander meets a fork in the road. Path 2 is followed.
A waterfall appears through the trees.

This I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door.
Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my chamber door-- Perched and sat and nothing more.

And this was the reason that, long ago, In a kingdom by the sea.
But the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting--still is sitting On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloating o'er, _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!
This I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my door!

As she said this, she was now, and she heard it muttering to itself â€˜The Duchess!

I was a child, In this kingdom by the sea, In her sepulchre there by the sea.
