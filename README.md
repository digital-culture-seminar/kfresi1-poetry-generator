Artist Statement 

I have a strong interest in the natural world and the colors and forms found therein. 
This is often the inspiration for my art and design work. This will be the 
inspiration for the poem in this class. As I began brainstorming for material 
to write a poem I began to pull ideas from the forest. I want my poem to describe 
the feeling of a forest in late spring.

In order to achieve this I plan to accumulate a group of nouns, verbs, adjectives
 and adverbs of create a poem describing the feeling the. I will focus on words
 that describe the temperature, lighting, foliage, and color.  
 The intent is that these will words will combine to create a feeling
 and environment of the natural world. 

Poem 

The effervescent forest slowly enchants the wander
while the warm sunlight softly filters through viridian leaves.
The wander meets a fork in the road. Path 2 is followed.
A waterfall appears through the trees.
