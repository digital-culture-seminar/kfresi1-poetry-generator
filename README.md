## Artist Statement 

I have a strong interest in the natural world and the colors and forms found therein. 
This is often the inspiration for my art and design work. This will be the 
inspiration for the poem in this class. As I began brainstorming for material 
to write a poem I began to pull ideas from the forest. I want my poem to describe 
the feeling of a forest in late spring.

In order to achieve this I plan to accumulate a group of nouns, verbs, adjectives
 and adverbs of create a poem describing the feeling the. I will focus on words
 that describe the temperature, lighting, foliage, and color.  
 The intent is that these will words will combine to create a feeling
 and environment of the natural world. 

## Steps to Poem Construction 
1. String format with list of nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives
2. Random chance with three paths and two possible outcomes
3. Markovify
4. Final string format for a conclusion

### Wandering
---
The effervescent forest slowly enchants the wanderer 
while the warm sunlight softly filters through viridian leaves.
The wanderer meets a fork in the road. Path 2 is followed.
A waterfall appears through the trees.
But there is no road through the woods Seventy years ago.
The effervescent forest slowly enchants.
