## Wandering
```The effervescent forest slowly enchants the wanderer while the warm sunlight softly filters through viridian leaves.```

```The wanderer meets a fork in the road. Path 1 is followed.```

```The wanderer then comes upon a clearing.```

```But there is no road through the woods Before they planted the trees.```

```The effervescent forest slowly enchants.```
